# ggpmisc #

Package '**ggpmisc**' (Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2') is a set of
extensions to R package 'ggplot2' (>= 2.1.0) useful when plotting diverse types
of data.  Currently available statistics, geoms and functions add facilities for
labeling peaks and valleys, generating labels for fitted models including
polynomial equations, highlighting deviations from a model fit, and for
filtering-out regions of plot panels with high densities of observations. 
Another group of ggplot statistics and geoms aim at easying the debugging new
geoms and statistics (or learning how they work). Plottng of time series data is
facilitated by a 'fortify-like' function.

Please, see the web site [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for
details and update notices. Other packages, aimed at easing photobiology-related
calculations including the quantification of biologically effective radiation in
meteorology are available as part of a suite described at the same website.

The current release of '__ggpmisc__' is available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggpmisc) 
for R (>= 3.2.0).
