Package __ggpmisc__ is a small set of extensions to ggplot2 (>= 2.0.0) which
I hope will be useful when plotting diverse types of data and/or debugging
ggplot plots.

Extensions:
- Function for conversion of time series data into data frames that can be
plotted with ggplot.
- Stats for locating and tagging "peaks" and "valleys" (local or global maxima
and minima).
- Stat for generating labels from a `lm()` model fit, including formatted
equation.
- _Debug_ stats and a geom that print to the console their `data` input.

Please, see the web site [R4Photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for 
details and update notices. Other packages, aimed at easing photobiology-related
calculations including the quantification of biologically effective radiation
in meteorology are available as part of a suite described at the same
website.

The current release of __ggpmisc__ is available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpmisc/index.html) 
for R (>= 3.2.0).
