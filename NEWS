ggpmisc 0.2.11
==============

Add stat_dens2d_labels(), a statistic that resets label values to NA by default,
or any character string supplied as argument, in regions of a panel with high
density of observations.
Add stat_den2d_filter(), a statistic that filters-out observations in regions
of a panel with high density of observations.
These two statistics are useful for labelling or highlighting observations in
regions of a panel with low density. Both stats uses a compute_panel function,
rather than a compute_group function.

ggpmisc 0.2.10
==============

Add user-requested feature: allow user to specify number 'digits' used in
formatting numbers in labels in stat_poly_eq().
Update try_data_frame() to return an object of class "tibble" and add
try_tibble() as synonym.
Update documentation and start using package 'staticdocs' to build a
documentation web site.

ggpmisc 0.2.9
=============

Add support for tikz in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in geom_debug().
Fix bug in stat_fit_augment().

ggpmisc 0.2.8
=============

Enhance stat_poly_eq() so that 1) position of labels according to npc (relative
positions using normalized coordinates), as well as by named positions "top",
"bottom", "right", "left" and "center" is now implemented; 2) when grouping is
present, suitable vjust values are computed to automatically position the
labels for the different groups without overlap. Default label positions are
now relative to the range of each panel's $x$ and $y$ scales, eliminating in
most cases the need to manually tweak label positions.

Add stat_fit_glance() uses package 'broom' for maximum flexibility in model
function choice when wanting to add labels based on information from a model
fit, at the expense of very frequently having to explicitly set aesthetics,
and always having to add code to do the formatting of the values to be used
in labels. Label position is as described above for stat_poly_eq().

Add stat_fit_deviations() for highlighting residuals in plots of fitted
models. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits. By default geom
"segment" is used to highlight the deviations of the observations from a
fitted model.

Add stat_fit_residuals() for plotting residuals from a fitted model on their
own in plots matching plots of lm fits plotted with stat_smooth() even with
grouping or facets. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits.
By default geom "point" is used to plot the residual from a fitted model.

Add preliminary version of stat_fit_augment(), which uses package 'broom' for
maximum flexibility in model function choice, to augment the data with
additional columns of values derived from a model fit.

ggpmisc 0.2.7
=============

Add support for AIC and BIC labels to stat_poly_eq().
Add pretty-printing of parameter values expressed in engineering notation in
stat_poly_eq().
Add support for user-supplied label coordinates in stat_poly_eq().
Improve stat_debug_panel() and stat_debug_group() so that they can optionally
print to the console a summary of the data received as input.
Add geom_debug(), a geom that summarizes its data input to the console, and
produces no visible graphical output.

ggpmisc 0.2.6
=============

Add support for user-supplied lhs and for user-supplied rhs-variable name in
the equation label in stat_poly_eq().

ggpmisc 0.2.5
=============

Remove one example to remove a package dependency.

ggpmisc 0.2.4
=============

Improve handling of time zones in try_data_frame().
Revise documentation and vignette.

ggpmisc 0.2.3
=============

stat_poly_eq() changed to include the lhs (left hand side) of the equation by
default.

ggpmisc 0.2.2
=============

Add function try_data_frame() to convert R objects including time series
objects of all classes accepted by try.xts() into data frames suitable for
plotting with ggplot().

Update stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() to work correctly when the x aesthetic
uses a Date or Datetime continuous scale such as ggplot() sets automatically
for POSIXct variables mapped to the x aesthetic.

ggpmisc 0.2.1
=============

Rename stat_debug() as stat_debug_group() and add stat_debug_panel().
Add stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() (these are simpler versions of
ggspectra::stat_peaks() and ggspectra::stat_valleys() for use with any
numerical data (rather than light spectra).

ggpmisc 0.1.0
=============

First version.
Add stat_poly_eq()
Add stat_debug()
