ggpmisc 0.2.17.9900
===================

Non-CRAN version with additional functionality, but requiring the
development version of 'ggplot2' >= 2.2.1.9000 (>= commit of 2017-02-09)
from Github. Visit

* geom_table(), a geom for adding a layer containing one or more tables to
a plot panel.
* stat_fit_tb() a stat that computes a tidy tabular version of the summary
or ANOVA table from a model fit.

ggpmisc 0.2.17
==============

CRAN version

* Add stat_quadrat_count() a stat that computes the number of observations in
each quadrat of a plot panel ignoring grouping.

* Fix bugs, one of which is code breaking: the names of returned parameter
estimates have changed in stat_fit_tidy() now pasting "_estimate" to avoid
name clashes with mapped variables.

ggpmisc 0.2.16
==============

* Revise stat_fit_tidy() so that it returns p-values for parameters, in additon
to estimates and their standard errors.
* BUG FIX: Revise geom_debug() adding missing default arguments.
* Add functions for manipulation of layers in ggplot objects: delete_layers(),
append_layers(), move_layers(), shift_layers(), which_layers(),
extract_layers(), num_layers(), top_layer() and bottom_layer().

ggpmisc 0.2.15
==============

Add stat_fit_tidy() implemented using broom::tidy(). Makes it possible to
add the fitted equation for any fitted model supported by package 'broom',
as long as the user supplies within aes() the code to build a label string.
Update user guide.

ggpmisc 0.2.14
==============

Fix bug in stat_poly_equation() eq.x.rhs argument ignored when using
expressions.

ggpmisc 0.2.13
==============

Fix bugs in try_tibble() and try_data_frame() which made them fail silently
with some objects of class "ts" in the case of numeric (decimal date)
index for time. In addition lack of special handling for classes
"yearmon" and "yearqrt" from package 'zoo', lead to erroneous
date shifts by a few days.
Add methods ggplot.ts() and ggplot.xts().

ggpmisc 0.2.12
==============

Change default value for parameter label.fill in stat_dens2d_labels()
from NA to "". Improve documentation using current 'ggrepel' version, which
implements changes that make stat_dens2d_labels() useful.

ggpmisc 0.2.11
==============

Add stat_dens2d_labels(), a statistic that resets label values to NA by default,
or any character string supplied as argument, in regions of a panel with high
density of observations.
Add stat_den2d_filter(), a statistic that filters-out/filters-in observations
in regions of a panel with high density of observations.
These two statistics are useful for labelling or highlighting observations in
regions of a panel with low density. Both stats use a compute_panel function.
Add stat_den2d_filter_g(), a statistic that filters-out/filters-in observations
in regions of a group with high density of observations. This statistics is
useful for highlighting observations. It uses a compute_group function.
They use internally `MASS:kde2d` to estimate densities and default values for
parameters are adjusted dynamically based on the number of observations.

ggpmisc 0.2.10
==============

Add user-requested feature: allow user to specify number 'digits' used in
formatting numbers in labels in stat_poly_eq().
Update try_data_frame() to return an object of class "tibble" and add
try_tibble() as synonym.
Update documentation and start using package 'staticdocs' to build a
documentation web site.

ggpmisc 0.2.9
=============

Add support for tikz in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in geom_debug().
Fix bug in stat_fit_augment().

ggpmisc 0.2.8
=============

Enhance stat_poly_eq() so that 1) position of labels according to npc (relative
positions using normalized coordinates), as well as by named positions "top",
"bottom", "right", "left" and "center" is now implemented; 2) when grouping is
present, suitable vjust values are computed to automatically position the
labels for the different groups without overlap. Default label positions are
now relative to the range of each panel's $x$ and $y$ scales, eliminating in
most cases the need to manually tweak label positions.

Add stat_fit_glance() uses package 'broom' for maximum flexibility in model
function choice when wanting to add labels based on information from a model
fit, at the expense of very frequently having to explicitly set aesthetics,
and always having to add code to do the formatting of the values to be used
in labels. Label position is as described above for stat_poly_eq().

Add stat_fit_deviations() for highlighting residuals in plots of fitted
models. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits. By default geom
"segment" is used to highlight the deviations of the observations from a
fitted model.

Add stat_fit_residuals() for plotting residuals from a fitted model on their
own in plots matching plots of lm fits plotted with stat_smooth() even with
grouping or facets. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits.
By default geom "point" is used to plot the residual from a fitted model.

Add preliminary version of stat_fit_augment(), which uses package 'broom' for
maximum flexibility in model function choice, to augment the data with
additional columns of values derived from a model fit.

ggpmisc 0.2.7
=============

Add support for AIC and BIC labels to stat_poly_eq().
Add pretty-printing of parameter values expressed in engineering notation in
stat_poly_eq().
Add support for user-supplied label coordinates in stat_poly_eq().
Improve stat_debug_panel() and stat_debug_group() so that they can optionally
print to the console a summary of the data received as input.
Add geom_debug(), a geom that summarizes its data input to the console, and
produces no visible graphical output.

ggpmisc 0.2.6
=============

Add support for user-supplied lhs and for user-supplied rhs-variable name in
the equation label in stat_poly_eq().

ggpmisc 0.2.5
=============

Remove one example to remove a package dependency.

ggpmisc 0.2.4
=============

Improve handling of time zones in try_data_frame().
Revise documentation and vignette.

ggpmisc 0.2.3
=============

stat_poly_eq() changed to include the lhs (left hand side) of the equation by
default.

ggpmisc 0.2.2
=============

Add function try_data_frame() to convert R objects including time series
objects of all classes accepted by try.xts() into data frames suitable for
plotting with ggplot().

Update stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() to work correctly when the x aesthetic
uses a Date or Datetime continuous scale such as ggplot() sets automatically
for POSIXct variables mapped to the x aesthetic.

ggpmisc 0.2.1
=============

Rename stat_debug() as stat_debug_group() and add stat_debug_panel().
Add stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() (these are simpler versions of
ggspectra::stat_peaks() and ggspectra::stat_valleys() for use with any
numerical data (rather than light spectra).

ggpmisc 0.1.0
=============

First version.
Add stat_poly_eq()
Add stat_debug()
