ggpmisc 0.3.7 (2020-11-09)
==========================

* Update stat_fit_tb() to support renaming of terms/parameter names in the
table (Suggested by Big Old Dave and Z. Lin). In addition implement selection,
reordering and renaming of columns and terms/parameters using positional indexes
and pattern maching of truncated names in addtion to whole names. Improve
formatting of small P-values.
* Update stat_fmt_tb() to support the same expanded syntax as stat_fit_tb().
* Add stat_dens1d_filter(), stat_dens1d_filter_g() and stat_dens1d_labels(),
to complement existing stat_dens2d_filter(), stat_dens2d_filter_g() and
stat_dens2d_labels().
* Update stat_dens2d_filter(), stat_dens2d_filter_g() and stat_dens2d_labels()
adding formal parameters keep.sparse and invert.selection, as available in the
new 1D versions.
* Update stat_dens2d_labels() to accept not only character strings but also
functions as argument to label.fill as the new stat_dens1d_labels() does.
* Revise documentation including the User Guide.

ggpmisc 0.3.6 (2020-09-06)
==========================

* Override ggplot2::annotate() adding support for aesthetics npcx and npcy.
* Add stat_summary_xy() and stat_centroid().
* Revise stat_poly_eq() to support labeling of equations according to group.
* Implement output.type "markdown" in stat_poly_eq() usable with geom_richtext()
from package 'ggtext'.

ggpmisc 0.3.5 (2020-06-01)
==========================

* Add support for "table themes" to geom_table() and geom_table_npc().

ggpmisc 0.3.4 (2020-04-22)
==========================

* Add support for p.value.label and f.value.label to stat_poly_eq().
* Update to track deprecations in 'ggplot2' (>= 3.3.0).

ggpmisc 0.3.3 (2019-11-23)
==========================

* Fix bug in stat_poly_eq().
* Minor revision of the User Guide and documentation.

ggpmisc 0.3.2 (2019-11-12)
==========================

This version implements some new features and fixes bugs in the features
introduced in version 0.3.1, please do rise an issue if you notice any
remaining bugs! Some reported weaknesses in the documentation have been
addressed. This updated version depends on 'ggplot2' (>= 3.2.1).

** Add support for volcano and quadrant plots of outcomes.
* Add geometries geom_vhlines() and geom_quadrant_lines().
* Add convenience scales scale_x_logFC() and scale_y_logFC() for data expressed
as fold change.
* Add convenience scales scale_x_Pvalue(), scale_y_Pvalue(), scale_x_FDR(),
scale_y_FDR().
* Add convenience scales scale_colour_outcome(), scale_fill_outcome() and
scale_shape_outcome() for data expressed as ternary or binary outcomes.
* Add conversion functions outcome2factor() and threshold2factor() to convert
vectors of numeric outcomes into factors with 2 or 3 levels.
* Add conversion function xy_outcomes2factor() and xy_thresholds2factor() to
combine two vectors of numeric outcomes into a 4-level factor.

** Improve support for model-fit annotations.
* Update stat_poly_eq() so that optionally instead of text labels it can return
numeric values extracted from the fit object.
* Document with examples how to pass weights and covariates to statistics based
on methods from package 'broom'. Highlight the differences among stat_poly_eq()
and the stat_fit_xxx() statistics implemented using package 'broom'.

** Revise stat_apply_fun() to allow simultaneous application of functions to
x and y aesthetics, and handling of diff() and other functions returning
slightly shorter vectors than their input.

** Support in stat_fit_tb(), stat_fit_augment(), stat_fit_tidy() and
stat_fit_glance() the use of character strings as position arguments for
parameters label.x and label.y when using geoms based on x and y aesthetics in
addition to when using those taking the npcx and npcy aesthetics.

ggpmisc 0.3.1 (2019-04-01)
==========================

This is a major update, with a few cases in which old code may need to be
revised to work, and many cases in which there will be subtle differences in
the positions of labels used as annotations. The many new features may still
have some bugs, please do rise an issue if you notice one!
Version requiring 'ggplot2' (>= 3.1.0).
- Add new geometries, several of them accepting x and y in npc units through
the new aesthetics npcx and npcy, allowing positioning relative to plotting
area irrespective of native data units and scale limits. These geometries are
useful on their own for annotations in particular they allow consistent
positioning of textual summaries. By default they do not inherit the plot's
aesthetic mappings making their behaviour remain by default in-between that
of true geometries and that of annotate().
* Add geom_text_npc() and geom_label_npc() using aesthetics npcx and npcy.
* Add geom_table_npc() using aesthetics npcx and npcy.
* Add geom_plot() and geom_plot_npc() which can be used to add inset plots
to a ggplot.
* Add geom_grob() and geom_grob_npc() which can be used to add inset grobs
to a ggplot.
* Add geom_x_margin_point(), geom_y_margin_point(), geom_x_margin_arrow() and
geom_y_margin_arrow() which behave similarly to geom_hline() and geom_vline()
but plot points or arrows instead of lines. Add geom_x_margin_grob() and
geom_y_margin_grob() with similar behaviour but for adding grobs.
- Revise textual-summary statistics to use the new npc version of geometries.
+ This may break old code that used geom_table() and depended on the old
default of inherit.aes=TRUE.
- Add "summarize" statistics for groups and panels.
* Add stat_apply_panel() and stat_apply_group().
- Fix bug.
* Add workaround to stat_fit_glance() and improve diagnosis of unsupported
input. Replace bad example in the corresponding documentation (workaround
for bug reported by Robert White).
- Update documentation.
* Add and revise examples.
* Revise vignette.

ggpmisc 0.3.0 (2018-07-16)
==========================

Version requiring 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0), now in CRAN.
Low level manipulation and debug methods and functions moved to new package
'gginnards' available through CRAN.
* Remove debug stats and geoms -> 'gginnards'.
* Remove layer manipulation functions -> 'gginnards'.
* Add support for "weight" aesthetic in stat_poly_eq() (fixing bug reported by
  S.Al-Khalidi).
* Add support for column selection and renaming to stat_fit_tb().
* Add new statistic stat_fmt_tb() for formatting of tibbles for addition to
  plots as tables.
* Rename stat_quadrat_count() into stat_quadrant_count() (miss-spelling).
* Revise vignette.

ggpmisc 0.2.17.9902
===================

Non-CRAN version with additional functionality, but requiring the
development version of 'ggplot2'.

* Track code breaking change in 'ggplot2' commit #2620 (2018-05-17).

ggpmisc 0.2.17.9900
===================

Non-CRAN version with additional functionality, but requiring the
development version of 'ggplot2' >= 2.2.1.9000 (>= commit of 2017-02-09)
from Github. Visit

* geom_table(), a geom for adding a layer containing one or more tables to
a plot panel.
* stat_fit_tb() a stat that computes a tidy tabular version of the summary
or ANOVA table from a model fit.

ggpmisc 0.2.17
==============

CRAN version

* Add stat_quadrat_count() a stat that computes the number of observations in
each quadrat of a plot panel ignoring grouping.

* Fix bugs, one of which is code breaking: the names of returned parameter
estimates have changed in stat_fit_tidy() now pasting "_estimate" to avoid
name clashes with mapped variables.

ggpmisc 0.2.16
==============

* Revise stat_fit_tidy() so that it returns p-values for parameters, in addition
to estimates and their standard errors.
* BUG FIX: Revise geom_debug() adding missing default arguments.
* Add functions for manipulation of layers in ggplot objects: delete_layers(),
append_layers(), move_layers(), shift_layers(), which_layers(),
extract_layers(), num_layers(), top_layer() and bottom_layer().

ggpmisc 0.2.15
==============

Add stat_fit_tidy() implemented using broom::tidy(). Makes it possible to
add the fitted equation for any fitted model supported by package 'broom',
as long as the user supplies within aes() the code to build a label string.
Update user guide.

ggpmisc 0.2.14
==============

Fix bug in stat_poly_equation() eq.x.rhs argument ignored when using
expressions.

ggpmisc 0.2.13
==============

Fix bugs in try_tibble() and try_data_frame() which made them fail silently
with some objects of class "ts" in the case of numeric (decimal date)
index for time. In addition lack of special handling for classes
"yearmon" and "yearqrt" from package 'zoo', lead to erroneous
date shifts by a few days.
Add methods ggplot.ts() and ggplot.xts().

ggpmisc 0.2.12
==============

Change default value for parameter label.fill in stat_dens2d_labels()
from NA to "". Improve documentation using current 'ggrepel' version, which
implements changes that make stat_dens2d_labels() useful.

ggpmisc 0.2.11
==============

Add stat_dens2d_labels(), a statistic that resets label values to NA by default,
or any character string supplied as argument, in regions of a panel with high
density of observations.
Add stat_den2d_filter(), a statistic that filters-out/filters-in observations
in regions of a panel with high density of observations.
These two statistics are useful for labelling or highlighting observations in
regions of a panel with low density. Both stats use a compute_panel function.
Add stat_den2d_filter_g(), a statistic that filters-out/filters-in observations
in regions of a group with high density of observations. This statistics is
useful for highlighting observations. It uses a compute_group function.
They use internally `MASS:kde2d` to estimate densities and default values for
parameters are adjusted dynamically based on the number of observations.

ggpmisc 0.2.10
==============

Add user-requested feature: allow user to specify number 'digits' used in
formatting numbers in labels in stat_poly_eq().
Update try_data_frame() to return an object of class "tibble" and add
try_tibble() as synonym.
Update documentation and start using package 'staticdocs' to build a
documentation web site.

ggpmisc 0.2.9
=============

Add support for tikz in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in stat_poly_eq().
Fix bug in geom_debug().
Fix bug in stat_fit_augment().

ggpmisc 0.2.8
=============

Enhance stat_poly_eq() so that 1) position of labels according to npc (relative
positions using normalized coordinates), as well as by named positions "top",
"bottom", "right", "left" and "center" is now implemented; 2) when grouping is
present, suitable vjust values are computed to automatically position the
labels for the different groups without overlap. Default label positions are
now relative to the range of each panel's $x$ and $y$ scales, eliminating in
most cases the need to manually tweak label positions.

Add stat_fit_glance() uses package 'broom' for maximum flexibility in model
function choice when wanting to add labels based on information from a model
fit, at the expense of very frequently having to explicitly set aesthetics,
and always having to add code to do the formatting of the values to be used
in labels. Label position is as described above for stat_poly_eq().

Add stat_fit_deviations() for highlighting residuals in plots of fitted
models. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits. By default geom
"segment" is used to highlight the deviations of the observations from a
fitted model.

Add stat_fit_residuals() for plotting residuals from a fitted model on their
own in plots matching plots of lm fits plotted with stat_smooth() even with
grouping or facets. This statistic currently supports only lm() fits.
By default geom "point" is used to plot the residual from a fitted model.

Add preliminary version of stat_fit_augment(), which uses package 'broom' for
maximum flexibility in model function choice, to augment the data with
additional columns of values derived from a model fit.

ggpmisc 0.2.7
=============

Add support for AIC and BIC labels to stat_poly_eq().
Add pretty-printing of parameter values expressed in engineering notation in
stat_poly_eq().
Add support for user-supplied label coordinates in stat_poly_eq().
Improve stat_debug_panel() and stat_debug_group() so that they can optionally
print to the console a summary of the data received as input.
Add geom_debug(), a geom that summarizes its data input to the console, and
produces no visible graphical output.

ggpmisc 0.2.6
=============

Add support for user-supplied lhs and for user-supplied rhs-variable name in
the equation label in stat_poly_eq().

ggpmisc 0.2.5
=============

Remove one example to remove a package dependency.

ggpmisc 0.2.4
=============

Improve handling of time zones in try_data_frame().
Revise documentation and vignette.

ggpmisc 0.2.3
=============

stat_poly_eq() changed to include the lhs (left hand side) of the equation by
default.

ggpmisc 0.2.2
=============

Add function try_data_frame() to convert R objects including time series
objects of all classes accepted by try.xts() into data frames suitable for
plotting with ggplot().

Update stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() to work correctly when the x aesthetic
uses a Date or Datetime continuous scale such as ggplot() sets automatically
for POSIXct variables mapped to the x aesthetic.

ggpmisc 0.2.1
=============

Rename stat_debug() as stat_debug_group() and add stat_debug_panel().
Add stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() (these are simpler versions of
ggspectra::stat_peaks() and ggspectra::stat_valleys() for use with any
numerical data (rather than light spectra).

ggpmisc 0.1.0
=============

First version.
Add stat_poly_eq()
Add stat_debug()
